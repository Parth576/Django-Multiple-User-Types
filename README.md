# Django-Multiple-User-Types
Basic Django application to implement multiple user types in Django using OneToOneField with Django's built in User. 

Created this repo because I could not find any code online for implementing the same. Did not want to extend AbstractUser class because that created other issues.

This example consists of two user types: Student and Teacher.
